ABSTRACT: Caribbean and Caribbean-adjacent countries are the largest source of Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. In addition to Mexico, recent studies (e.g. as part of the Caribbean American Dementia and Aging Study, CADAS) have been collecting microdata on healthy aging in the Dominican Republic and Cuba as well as in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Other adjacent countries with large emigrant populations in the U.S. include Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. U.S. immigrants from these countries have experienced highly disparate lifecourse conditions. This paper will analyze the most recent available Census microdata in IPUMS from each of these countries, to make comparisons with recent U.S. Census and American Community Survey data. A key focus will be to describe the education, marital status, and co-residence of older adults in each sending country in relation to the corresponding foreign-born population in the U.S., disaggregated by sex and age group; in the U.S. we will also compare by cohort of entry and citizenship status.\'a0 We will also use a household socioeconomic status (SES) index harmonized across the Caribbean countries to compare the older adult SES levels by demographic group across the sending countries, and similarly compare SES of each foreign-born group in the U.S. These data will be used in combination with birth country-level institutional data for each country cohort to create stylized facts on the heterogeneity of older adult immigrant lifecourse experiences and well-being, and develop hypotheses for future cross-national comparative research on the determinants of Caribbean Hispanic older adult health.}
