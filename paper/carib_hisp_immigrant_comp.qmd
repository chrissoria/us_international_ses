  Caribbean and nearby countries are key sources of Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. Recent studies, including the Caribbean American Dementia and Aging Study (CADAS), have collected data on healthy aging in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Other significant emigrant countries include Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Immigrants from these regions have diverse life experiences. This paper analyzes the latest Census microdata from these countries using IPUMS, comparing it with U.S. Census and American Community Survey data. We focus on education, marital status, and co-residence of older adults in each country, compared to their counterparts in the U.S., disaggregated by sex and age group. In the U.S., we also examine cohort entry and citizenship status. This data will be combined with institutional data to explore the varied experiences and well-being of older adult immigrants, forming hypotheses for future research on Caribbean Hispanic older adult health determinants.

## Introduction and Background {#sec-intro}
Caribbean and nearby countries are key sources of Hispanic immigrants to the United Sates [@passel_what_2024]. In 2022, people of Mexican origin made up nearly 60% of the U.S. Hispanic population, totaling about 37.4 million. Puerto Ricans were the next largest group at 5.9 million, with 3.2 million living on the island. Salvadorans, Cubans, Dominicans, Guatemalans, Colombians, and Hondurans each have populations exceeding 1 million in the United States. Venezuelans experienced the fastest growth among U.S. Latinos between 2010 and 2022, with a 236% increase in population reaching 815,000[@noe-bustamante_key_2023].
